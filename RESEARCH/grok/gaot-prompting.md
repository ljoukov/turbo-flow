Below, I'll address your questions about the Geometry Aware Operator Transformer (GAOT) based on the details in the provided paper ("Geometry Aware Operator Transformer As An Efficient And Accurate Neural Surrogate For PDEs On Arbitrary Domains"). I'll reference specific sections, figures, and results from the paper for accuracy. GAOT is designed for learning PDE solution operators on arbitrary domains, with a focus on handling varying geometries efficiently.

### 1. Does GAOT Require Retraining for Each New Geometry?

No, GAOT does **not require retraining for each new geometry** in most cases, especially if the model is trained on a diverse dataset that includes geometry variations. It is explicitly designed to generalize to unseen geometries without full retraining, thanks to its geometry-aware architecture and training paradigm. Here's a breakdown:

#### Key Evidence from the Paper

- **Handling Varying Geometries During Training**: GAOT is trained on datasets where geometries vary across samples (denoted as "GeoVar=T" in Table D.1 of the supplementary material). For example:

  - In the Bluff-Body dataset (newly proposed in the paper, Sec. D.2.2), geometries vary significantly (e.g., squares, circles, cones, ellipses—see Fig. E.6a). GAOT achieves a low median relative $$L^1$$ error of 2.25% without per-geometry retraining (Table 1).
  - On the large-scale DrivAerNet++ dataset (3D car aerodynamics with ~8K varying car shapes, Sec. 3), GAOT sets state-of-the-art performance (Table 3) on surface fields like pressure and wall shear stress, handling ~500K points per shape. Geometries vary per sample, and no retraining per car is mentioned.
  - Benchmarks like NACA/RAE airfoils (Sec. D.2.1) involve perturbed shapes (e.g., via CST parameterization), and GAOT generalizes across them (errors ~5-7%, Table 1).

- **Generalization to Unseen Geometries**: GAOT supports zero-shot or few-shot generalization:

  - **Zero-Shot**: Once trained on diverse geometries, it can infer on new ones via its geometry embeddings (Sec. B.3) and attentional mechanisms (Sec. B.2). These encode local domain info (e.g., neighbors, distances, PCA features) into tokens, allowing the model to adapt at inference time without retraining. For instance, in Sec. E.6, GAOT is tested on unseen bluff-body shapes and performs well zero-shot.
  - **Few-Shot Fine-Tuning**: For out-of-distribution geometries, fine-tuning with a few samples is efficient and outperforms training from scratch (Fig. 3c in main text, Sec. E.6). E.g., fine-tuning with 128-1024 samples reduces error by nearly an order of magnitude on new shapes.
  - **Resolution Invariance**: It generalizes to new point distributions (e.g., finer/coarser grids) without retraining (Sec. E.5, Fig. E.5), which is proxy for geometry changes.

- **When Might Retraining Be Needed?**

  - If the new geometry is **highly out-of-distribution** (e.g., radically different from training shapes, like switching from 2D airfoils to 3D rockets), full retraining or extensive fine-tuning could be required. The paper notes this as a limitation (Sec. 4) and suggests extensions like foundation models (e.g., Poseidon [20] in references) for broader generalization.
  - In practice, train on diverse geometries upfront (as in DrivAerNet++ with 8K shapes) to minimize this.

- **Why It Works Without Per-Geometry Retraining**:
  - **Geometry as Input**: Geometry is parameterized via $$\chi_D$$ (e.g., indicator or signed distance function) and embedded dynamically (Sec. 2, B.3). This makes GAOT "geometry-conditional" at inference.
  - **Efficiency**: Scalable implementation (Sec. 2) handles varying domains per sample without overhead (e.g., precompute graphs, edge-dropping for large graphs).
  - **Empirical Robustness**: GAOT's robustness score (Sec. E.1, Fig. 1 radar chart) is ~3x higher than baselines on varying-geometry datasets, indicating reliable performance on new shapes.

In summary, GAOT is built for arbitrary/varying domains, so retraining per geometry is unnecessary if your training data includes diversity. For novel cases, few-shot fine-tuning suffices. This is a strength over methods like message-passing GNNs (e.g., RIGNO baselines), which may need more adaptation.

### 2. What's Promptable in Their Approach?

GAOT is not "promptable" in the traditional sense of large language models (LLMs), where you use natural language prompts to adapt behavior without retraining (e.g., via in-context learning). It's a neural operator for PDEs, not a generative text model. However, analogizing "prompting" to **conditional inference** or **few-shot adaptation**, several aspects of GAOT can be seen as "promptable"—you can flexibly condition the model on new inputs (e.g., geometries, parameters) at inference time without retraining. This aligns with zero/few-shot generalization in operator learning.

#### Promptable Elements in GAOT

- **Geometry as a "Prompt"**:

  - Geometry ($$\chi_D$$) is an explicit input (Sec. 2, Eq. 1-2). You can "prompt" with a new domain (e.g., point cloud of a nozzle or car shape) at inference, and GAOT adapts via its geometry embeddings (Sec. B.3) and MAGNO (Sec. B.2). No retraining needed if within distribution.
  - Example: In transfer learning (Sec. E.6, Fig. 3c), provide a new bluff-body shape as input (like a prompt), and GAOT generates solutions zero-shot or with few-shot fine-tuning. This is similar to in-context learning but for geometries.

- **Parameters/Time as Prompts**:

  - For time-dependent PDEs (Eq. 2), inputs include current time $$t$$ and lead-time $$\tau$$ (Sec. 2). You can "prompt" with arbitrary $$t, \tau$$ to query future states (e.g., direct or autoregressive inference, Sec. B.6).
  - PDE coefficients $$c$$ (e.g., Mach number, viscosity) are inputs, so you can prompt with new values for what-if scenarios (e.g., unseen Mach in ML4LM).

- **Few-Shot Adaptation (Like Prompt Tuning)**:
  - GAOT supports few-shot transfer learning (Sec. E.6): Fine-tune on a small set of new samples (e.g., for unseen geometries) as "prompts." This outperforms full retraining and is computationally cheap.
