# D2. Top 10 Transferable Ideas for Controllable CFD Generators

**1. Latent Diffusion Models with Physical Conditioning:** _Example:_ CoNFiLD (2024) integrates a coordinate-based neural field with latent **diffusion** to generate realistic turbulent flows ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.05940v1#:~:text=This%20study%20introduces%20the%20Conditional,frameworks%2C%20which%20fall%20short%20in)). The key transferable idea is using a **low-dimensional latent space** to store flow snapshots and performing stochastic diffusion there – this yields huge speed-ups and captures flow _uncertainty_. Conditioning enters via **feature-wise modulation (FiLM)** in the neural field, allowing prompts like sensor readings or desired boundary conditions to guide the generation ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.05940v1#:~:text=Linear%20Modulation%20%28FiLM%29%C2%A0,The%20mathematical)). This approach is **generative** (samples new fields) and naturally produces a distribution of possible flows rather than one deterministic output. It has been demonstrated on unstructured and irregular domains (using neural coordinate fields) and exhibits **zero-shot generalization** (e.g. generating flow in a domain with new wall roughness without retraining) ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.05940v1#:~:text=3.%203.1.3%20Generating%20non,4%20Discussion)). **Suitability:** Latent diffusion is promising for _transient compressible flows_ – it can handle high-dimensional outputs and uncertainty. However, current CoNFiLD examples are mostly subsonic/incompressible; extending to high-Mach flows would require embedding shock physics (e.g. using entropy conditions in the loss). The method’s mesh-free nature and conditioning flexibility make it top-tier for transfer to problems like supersonic plume–flow interaction, where one could prompt the model with jet conditions or obstacles and generate a plausible flow field rapidly.

**2. Multi-Fidelity & Physics-Guided Generators:** _Example:_ MPDM (2024) introduces a modular way to fuse coarse and fine simulations using diffusion models ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.17720v1/#:~:text=MPDM%20categorizes%20multi,The%20probabilistic%20nature%20of)). The broader idea is **conditioning generation on auxiliary physics models** – e.g. a fast inviscid solver or a low-res CFD – to guide the ML model. This improves fidelity and generality: the coarse model provides a baseline that the diffusion model then “super-resolves” or corrects. The conditioning is injected during the reverse diffusion process via a learned energy term that attracts the sample toward the coarse simulation state ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.17720v1/#:~:text=The%20augmented%20dataset%20enables%20us,prediction%20as%20its%20contextual%20input)). Importantly, this decouples training: you can train the diffusion on high-res data alone, and separately train (or use) a cheap physics surrogate for guidance. **Transferability:** This concept is very relevant to engineering flows where we have multi-fidelity data (e.g. an analytical plume model vs. a costly PIC code). A generative model can be trained on high-fidelity samples (like LES of a rocket plume), and at run-time prompt it with an inexpensive approximation (like a rarefied fluid approximation) to produce a high-fidelity realization. The method is **predictive** in that it outputs a single desired field given inputs, but built on a generative foundation (it can produce stochastic variations around the coarse baseline). It is well-suited for transient compressible regimes if a lower-fidelity solver (perhaps Euler or RANS) is available to guide the high-frequency content. This greatly improves reliability on **out-of-distribution conditions** – a major concern if, say, generating flows at Mach numbers higher than seen in training.

**3. Learned Surrogates for High-Speed Coupled Physics:** _Example:_ The hypersonic fluid-thermal-structural surrogate (2023) uses a deep neural net to map flight conditions to coupled fields ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S127096382300295X#:~:text=emergence%20of%20high,requirements%20due%20to%20its%20extremely)). Its success highlights two ideas: (a) **Encoding multiple physics fields together** (fluid pressure, temperature, structural stress) in one model and (b) injecting **problem parameters as part of the input vector** to enable promptability. The model is trained on a family of scenarios (varying Mach, angle-of-attack, etc.), effectively learning a parametric relationship. At inference, the user can turn the _knobs_ (Mach, angle, material property) as a prompt, and the network predicts the new steady-state solution. This is a **predictive** surrogate (one forward mapping), but it’s _controllable_ by design of input features. It’s implemented on structured grids (e.g. fixed mesh around a vehicle), so one limitation is geometry changes require retraining – but for a given configuration, it’s extremely fast. **Transferability:** The idea of a monolithic DNN surrogate that includes aero-thermo-elastic physics is transferable to things like **supersonic retropropulsion (SRP)** flows where fluid, combustion, and possibly shock loads on structure interact. One could imagine a network trained on a parameterized SRP scenario (varying thrust, Mach, attitude) predicting flowfield and pressures on the vehicle. The challenge is ensuring the architecture can handle shock discontinuities – likely requiring special loss terms (the 2023 study used custom loss to capture shocks). The concept is compatible with _transient_ problems if extended with recurrent/temporal models, but most current examples (like this one) focus on steady or quasi-steady fields.

**4. **Conditional RNN Generators for Parameterized Transients:**_ Example:_ Morton et al. (2019) parameterized VAE+RNN successfully generates flow evolutions conditioned on a single parameter ([ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1912.06752#:~:text=The%20computational%20cost%20associated%20with,the%20corresponding%20computational%20fluid%20dynamics)). This approach of **learning a latent dynamics model** that is explicitly conditioned (by concatenation or modulation) on a prompt vector (like Reynolds number) is highly transferable. It allows one trained model to produce an entire time-series of flow for any user-specified parameter within the trained range. The advantages are clear for controllability: e.g., an engineer can query “what if I double the jet velocity?” and obtain a full trajectory with zero additional simulation. The model is **autoregressive predictive** (it maps [state_{t}, param] -> state\_{t+1}), not truly generative in the probabilistic sense (it produces one likely outcome). Yet, by sampling latent initial states one could produce varied outcomes if needed. **Compatibility:** Such models can work with **unstructured meshes** if combined with graph neural network encoders (the 2019 example was on structured grids). For _transient compressible flows_, one would incorporate the Mach number or specific impulse as a conditioning variable. The limitation is that training these sequential models is tricky for highly chaotic flows – errors can compound. But coupling them with occasional correction (or hybrid with physics) can mitigate that. The core idea – **learn a reduced-order representation and its param-dependent evolution\*\* – is essentially a learned parametric ROM. This directly addresses the gap where classical ROMs struggle (they often need re-tuning for new conditions), making it a strong candidate for prompt-driven flow generation in regimes like SRP.

**5. Boundary-Condition Embedded Neural Solvers:** _Example:_ The Boundary-embedded PINN and FNO approaches (2024–2025) show that explicitly including geometry/BC information in the network input or architecture yields networks that **naturally generalize to new shapes or BCs** ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17364v1#:~:text=The%20previously%20analyzed%20methodology%20can,to%20the%20input%20space%20of)). In the PINN case, adding the angle-of-attack as an input coordinate extended the solution to a continuum of values ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.17364v1#:~:text=the%20network%20to%20solve%20the,parameterize%20the%20angle%20of%20attack)). In the FNO case, encoding boundary values into the input tensor allowed one model to handle different wall conditions. The transferability point is **prompt = boundary condition or geometry**. For instance, one could encode the shape of an injector or the stagnation pressure at an inlet as part of the model’s input. The network then learns a _continuous mapping_ from that prompt to the solution. This is powerful for design spaces – the model essentially becomes a fast parametric solver. Importantly, these methods are **predictive (deterministic)** rather than generative; they aim to exactly solve the physics for the given prompt (provided it lies in the training distribution). They typically require training on _many_ combinations of BC/geometry to cover that space. For compressible flow applications, this is feasible (e.g. train on various wedge angles, predict shock angle for new wedge). PINNs ensure physics fidelity but can be slow to train; neural operators (FNO, DeepONet) with boundary embedding are quicker to evaluate after training and more amenable to complex prompts (like an entire geometry encoded as a distance field). Overall, the concept of **embedding the prompt into the solver’s input space** ensures the model is _controllable_ by design, making it a top choice for tasks like “predict this new rocket nozzle flow given its shape and exit pressure.”

**6. Generative Adversarial Networks for Super-Resolution and Control:** _Example:_ tempoGAN (2018) and the GAN-based turbulence controller (2024) illustrate two transferable GAN paradigms. **(a) Super-resolution GAN:** The idea here is to use a **GAN to add missing physics scales** – one can prompt with a coarse flowfield (or a RANS field) and the GAN (as a generative model) outputs a refined field with small-scale structures ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322818881_tempoGAN_A_Temporally_Coherent_Volumetric_GAN_for_Super-resolution_Fluid_Flow#:~:text=,This%20person%20is%20not)). This is directly useful in compressible turbulence where large-scale features might be captured by cheaper methods and the GAN fills in fine-scale turbulence or shock details. It’s generative, producing one plausible realization that looks physically realistic (adversarial training tries to fool a discriminator that it’s from a high-fidelity distribution). **(b) Goal-driven GAN control:** Using a differentiable surrogate (like PredictionNet) in a GAN framework to **optimize an input (control) for a desired outcome** is a very powerful concept ([www.cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/prediction-and-control-of-twodimensional-decaying-turbulence-using-generative-adversarial-networks/EAE377A4E1F784D135520DB1EE3F25A0#:~:text=been%20conducted%2C%20yielding%20successful%20control,Thus%2C%20we)) ([www.cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/prediction-and-control-of-twodimensional-decaying-turbulence-using-generative-adversarial-networks/EAE377A4E1F784D135520DB1EE3F25A0#:~:text=In%20this%20study%2C%20the%20dynamics,A%C2%A0quantitative%20comparison%20of%20the%20prediction)). Essentially, the “prompt” is an objective functional, and the GAN framework finds a control field (like an initial disturbance or blowing/suction profile) that steers the flow to meet that objective. This turns flow generation from passive to _active_. Transferable to SRP/coolant-jet: one could envision using a trained surrogate of a jet-in-crossflow, then finding the jet nozzle modulation that yields, say, maximum mixing or minimum footprint, via gradient-based search on the surrogate. GANs provide the needed flexibility in high-dimensional control spaces and can handle multiple objectives by appropriate loss design. The caution is that GAN training can be unstable and might require large data. But the concept of **super-resolving flows and performing design optimization via generative models** is highly relevant to making controllable CFD tools.

**7. Graph Neural Network Simulators for Arbitrary Geometries:** _Example:_ MeshGraphNets (2020) proved that **message-passing neural nets can learn physics on irregular meshes** and generalize to new domains ([dl.acm.org](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3524938.3525722#:~:text=Learning%20to%20simulate%20complex%20physics,Our)). This means a single trained GNN can simulate flows around shapes not seen before, provided they are represented as graph inputs. The conditioning here is implicit: the **graph structure itself is the prompt** (it encodes the geometry/domain), and one can also tag boundary nodes with boundary condition values. The network then predicts the next-state, thus it's an _iterative predictive_ model (often rolled out for unsteady simulation). The ability to handle unstructured meshes is crucial for complex jet configurations, e.g. a jet issuing into a chamber with obstacles – a graph can represent that configuration, and the same model can run physics on it. **Transferability:** GNN-based simulators are naturally suited for _transient compressible flows_ if extended to include pressure waves and shocks – recent works are exploring this by incorporating attention or adaptive time stepping. They are _deterministic predictors_ (though one could add stochastic message outputs to make them generative). For SRP, a GNN could be trained on a variety of vehicle geometries and plume conditions, then **prompted by feeding in a new vehicle mesh with boundary conditions** to predict the flowfield evolution. This eliminates re-meshing costs across different designs, offering a genuinely interactive CFD tool. The main transferable insight is **geometry as input data** – unlike CNNs which need fixed grids, GNNs allow the model to be conditioned on almost any shape or topology, a critical feature for a general CFD generator.

**8. Score-Based Models (Flow Matching, Diffusion) for Uncertainty Quantification:** _Example:_ Parikh et al. (2025) using conditional flow matching for turbulence shows how **probabilistic generative models can quantify uncertainty in flow predictions** and incorporate ill-posed data ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14485#:~:text=2025,posed%20problem)). The broader idea: use **score-based models** (either diffusion or direct flow matching) to sample from the posterior distribution of flowfields given some conditioning (e.g. sparse measurements). This is highly transferable to scenarios like **coolant jet mixing**, where measurements might be sparse (a few temperature sensors) and one wants a likely full-field prediction _with uncertainty bounds_. Score-based methods are inherently generative – each sample is different but drawn from the learned distribution matching past data and physics constraints. They can be made mesh-independent by operating in function spaces, and can handle complex boundary prompts by including them in the score conditions (as done with wall data in Parikh’s case). For _compressible flows_, score-based models need to handle discontinuities carefully (possibly via specialized noise schedules or shock-aligned coordinates), but conceptually they offer a way to **get not just one prediction, but a family of plausible flow outcomes** given uncertain inputs. This is invaluable for risk assessment in high-speed flows (e.g. plume
**9. Multi-Modal Prompting (Images, Sensor Data as Inputs):** The shock–boundary layer CNN example illustrates that **visual or sensor data can serve as a prompt** to ML models ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5521/9/8/173/xml#:~:text=leverages%20non,been%20instrumental%20in%20compiling%20a)). This expands the notion of “prompt” beyond simulation parameters – one can feed a schlieren image or temperature map to guide a neural solver. The network essentially performs sensor fusion, translating experimental observations directly into flow predictions. _Transferability:_ For SRP or jet flows, this could mean using a **quick diagnostics (e.g. plume photographs or pressure probe readings)** as input to a trained model that immediately yields quantities of interest (like wall loads or flowfield) without a full simulation. It marries data-driven models with real-time measurement, enabling **hybrid analytics and control**. A practical vision is a system where a rocket test’s plume image is input and the ML model outputs the inferred thrust distribution or shock structure – a form of AI-enhanced flow diagnostics. This idea turns ML models into **fast surrogate sensors**, and given the complexity of high-speed flows, leveraging multiple data modalities as prompts can greatly improve reliability and utility of generative CFD models.

**10. Real-Time Differentiable Surrogates for Control:** Several examples (e.g. turbulence ControlNet, transformer FSI) underscore the value of **fast and differentiable** ML surrogates in a control loop ([www.cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/prediction-and-control-of-twodimensional-decaying-turbulence-using-generative-adversarial-networks/EAE377A4E1F784D135520DB1EE3F25A0#:~:text=been%20conducted%2C%20yielding%20successful%20control,Thus%2C%20we)) ([www.unic.ac.cy](https://www.unic.ac.cy/high-speed-fluid-structure-interaction-predictions-using-deep-learning-transformer-architecture/#:~:text=Fluid,Brouwer%2C%20Zachary%20B)). The transferable concept is that once a CFD surrogate is conditioned on user inputs (geometry, boundary actuations, etc.), it can be embedded in optimization and control algorithms. Because these networks are differentiable, one can compute gradients of an objective (say, drag or mixing efficiency) with respect to the prompt (say, jet nozzle angles) and thus perform rapid design optimization or **closed-loop control**. For transient compressible flows like SRP, this could enable, for instance, optimizing injection control profiles or gimbaling angles in real-time to achieve desired outcomes (stabilizing a shock location, minimizing base pressure, etc.). Traditional CFD-in-the-loop is far too slow for such tasks, but a trained neural surrogate running at kHz rates changes the game. _Compatibility:_ Generative models can produce _multiple scenarios per second_, allowing Monte Carlo evaluation of control strategies under uncertainties. This concept directly addresses the need for **controllability** – not only can the user prompt the model, but the model can inform the _best_ prompt to achieve a goal. In summary, the synergy of prompt-able CFD models with optimization techniques is a highly promising direction to actively _design and control_ high-speed flow systems.

# D3. Gap Analysis for SRP/Jet Applications

Despite rapid progress in ML for CFD, significant gaps remain before we have a **controllable generator** for supersonic retropropulsion (SRP) or coolant jet flows:

- **Lack of High-Mach, Multi-Physics Datasets:** Most current models focus on subsonic or mildly supersonic regimes. There is a **dearth of training data** for Mach 5–15 plume flows, especially with combustion or particle-laden effects. For SRP (e.g. Mars lander plumes), high-fidelity simulations are extremely costly and experimental data is limited – this hinders training of robust ML models. A concerted effort is needed to curate multi-fidelity data (DNS/LES, wind tunnel) for these regimes. Without it, existing models remain untested in the SRP scenario and may not generalize.

- **Handling of Shocks and Discontinuities:** Continuity of physics (smooth fields) is assumed by many neural architectures (e.g. FNO, standard CNNs). **Embedded shocks, contact discontinuities, and blast waves** challenge these methods – they often produce smoothed or unphysical results if asked to extrapolate beyond training (e.g. a higher Mach prompt). There’s a research gap in making generative models **shock-aware** (possible approaches: shock-capturing losses, hybrid ML-PDE solvers, or XPINN domain decompositions for discontinuities ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358846732_Physics-informed_neural_networks_for_inverse_problems_in_supersonic_flows#:~:text=These%20inverse%20problems%20are%20notoriously,we%20enforce%20positivity%20conditions%20on))). To reliably handle SRP flows, which feature strong shocks and expansion fans, ML models must incorporate physical priors for discontinuities or be combined with partial differential equation solvers (hybrid schemes).

- **Limited Geometry Generalization in High-speed Flows:** Although graph-based and coordinate-based networks can handle variable geometry, none of the current high-speed flow models explicitly tackle **complex 3D geometries with jets** (like a full lander with multiple engines). The interaction of multiple plumes and vehicle surfaces presents a combinatorial prompt (multi-jet conditions, 3D shape) that current models haven’t addressed. Research is needed on scaling neural operators or mesh-independent models to more complex boundaries and ensuring training covers a sufficient design space. This includes axisymmetric and fully 3D coordinate systems – many examples in literature are 2D or simple 3D domains.

- **Integration of Reaction Chemistry and Multi-species flows:** Coolant jets and SRP flows often involve **combustion (multi-species reacting flow)** or phase change (like particulate dust in lunar lander plumes). Present ML surrogates typically handle a single-fluid with simple equation of state (or at most a passive scalar). There’s a gap in extending generative models to mix multiple species or reactants – for instance, predicting fuel–air mixing and ignition in a supersonic combustor given a prompt. Solutions might involve multi-field outputs (one per species) and enforcing element-wise conservation in the model architecture. This is largely uncharted territory.

- **Trustworthiness and Extrapolation:** For safety-critical applications like spacecraft landing, a generator that only interpolates within training data is not enough – we need guarantees it won’t **err wildly on new conditions**. Currently, prompt-able models lack rigorous uncertainty quantification in outputs (though flow matching and diffusion approaches are a step in this direction) and can be “confident but wrong” if the prompt is outside the learned manifold. There’s a gap in developing **verification methods** (checking ML outputs against physical laws) and in building `know-when-it-doesn’t-know` capabilities into the model. Bridging this gap is crucial for adoption in SRP: one may incorporate PINN-style residual checks or conservation-law penalties when generating flows for unseen prompts.

**Where to focus research efforts:** Developing **hybrid ML-PDE frameworks** that marry prompt-able neural networks with the reliability of physics solvers could address many gaps. For example, using a neural network to provide an initial solution or subgrid model (prompted by conditions), then a fast CFD corrector to enforce hard constraints, could handle shocks and multi-species consistency. Investing in **high-Mach training data and multi-fidelity learning** will broaden model applicability. Finally, pushing conditional generative models to include **control inputs and objectives** (not just passive prompts) will be key for coolant flow control and SRP landing scenarios – essentially training models not just to predict flows, but to _respond_ to actuation prompts in a physically valid way. These advancements would move us closer to a practical “CFD-GPT” for supersonic and hypersonic engineering.
