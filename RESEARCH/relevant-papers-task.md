## AI Web Research Task: Recent Advances in Machine Learning for Supersonic Retropropulsion (SRP)

**Objective:** Identify, analyze, and summarize high-quality, recent (post-2017) research and development in the application of machine learning (ML) to Supersonic Retropropulsion (SRP) for planetary entry, descent, and landing (EDL), with a specific focus on methodologies that align with or advance beyond the hybrid physics-embedded data-driven (HPDD) framework presented in "ML4LM: Machine Learning for Safely Landing on Mars."

**Background Context (for the AI Agent):**
The provided ML4LM paper (circa 2022 NeurIPS workshop, but referencing 2010-2012 data/literature) introduces an HPDD framework for predicting the axial force coefficient (C) during SRP. Its key features are:

1.  **Hybrid Approach:** Combines physics-based analytical models (Co, CSRP) with a neural network (CNN) for residual correction.
2.  **Computational Efficiency:** Achieves very fast prediction times (0.03s per prediction).
3.  **Interpretability/Robustness:** Physics components ensure well-behaved outputs and interpretability, with the NN primarily acting as a small corrector.
4.  **Data Sparsity Management:** Leverages limited wind tunnel data effectively.
5.  **Multi-Nozzle Focus:** Addresses complex plume-plume and plume-freestream interactions in multi-nozzle configurations.

The previously provided papers ("Computational Analysis..." and "Performance Characterization...") represent traditional CFD simulations and empirical modeling from the 2010-2012 era, highlighting their computational cost and potential limitations in capturing complex nonlinearities or generalizing.

**Core Research Questions to Answer (for each relevant finding):**

1.  **Methodology Alignment:** Does the research employ machine learning? If so, what type? (e.g., Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), hybrid ML, data-driven ROMs, surrogate models, deep learning for CFD acceleration/parameterization, reinforcement learning for control).
2.  **Application Domain:** Is it directly related to SRP or closely analogous aerospace/fluid dynamics problems (e.g., other high-speed aero-propulsive interactions, jet-in-crossflow, hypersonic flow)?
3.  **Problem Solved:** What specific physical quantity or behavior is being predicted/modeled? (e.g., aerodynamic forces, heat flux, flowfield features, stability derivatives, optimal trajectories).
4.  **Data Source/Generation:** What data is used for training/validation? (e.g., experimental wind tunnel data, high-fidelity CFD simulations, flight data).
5.  **Comparative Advantage:** How does the proposed ML method compare to traditional methods (CFD, empirical models) in terms of:
    - **Computational Efficiency/Speed:** Is a significant speedup reported?
    - **Accuracy:** How accurate are the predictions against ground truth (experiments/high-fidelity CFD)?
    - **Interpretability/Robustness:** Are these aspects discussed? Are methods taken to ensure physical consistency or generalizability?
    - **Uncertainty Quantification (UQ):** Is UQ addressed?
6.  **Multi-Nozzle/Complex Interactions:** Does the research specifically address multi-nozzle configurations or highly complex plume-freestream interactions?
7.  **Key Findings/Novelty:** What are the main contributions or breakthroughs?
