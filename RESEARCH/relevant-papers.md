   **Summary of Relevance to ML4LM:** This work introduces a **hybrid surrogate model** combining Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for dimensionality reduction with a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network to predict unsteady flow features of a counterflow jet (analogous to SRP) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11775303/#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20the%20usage,performance%20of%20this%20hybrid%20technique)). It models time-series evolution of **axial velocity, pressure, and coolant mass fraction** fields during transient jet injection. Training is done on high-fidelity CFD data (supersonic nose injection scenario). Compared to traditional CFD, the approach yields **near-real-time predictions** of the flowfield. It maintains reasonable accuracy, though larger errors were found in regions with complex vortices (e.g. recirculation zone) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11775303/#:~:text=defined,vortex%20in%20the%20recirculation%20region)). The method addresses data sparsity by capturing dominant flow modes via POD, and the LSTM provides a data-driven temporal evolution on those modes. **Interpretability** is enhanced by the POD basis (related to physical flow structures), and **robustness** is improved by the physics-inspired mode truncation. No explicit **UQ** is reported, but the authors discuss sources of error (vortex complexity) and the sensitivity to training data fraction. Multi-nozzle interactions are not directly studied (the case is a single injection), but the success in capturing a complex jet-freestream interaction suggests potential for extension to multi-jet SRP flows.  
   **Key Contribution/Novelty:** Demonstrates a **POD+LSTM reduced-order model** for a supersonic counterflow jet, achieving **two orders of magnitude faster** predictions than CFD while retaining key flow physics. The hybrid ML approach explains discrepancies (e.g., higher error in recirculation regions) by analyzing POD modes, linking model performance to physical flow features ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11775303/#:~:text=predictive%20surrogate%20model%20with%20Full,vortex%20in%20the%20recirculation%20region)).  
   **Identified Gaps/Future Work:** The authors note reduced accuracy in highly vortical regions and suggest that augmenting the model (e.g., additional modes or improved ML architecture) could better capture complex unsteady features. Future work is implied in extending this framework to **multi-jet configurations** and incorporating **uncertainty quantification** to assess prediction confidence in safety-critical EDL scenarios.

2. **Title:** _Data-Augmented Turbulence Modeling for Supersonic Base Flow of an Axisymmetric Body_ (AIAA SciTech Forum, 2024)  
   **Authors:** Seoyeon Heo, Yeji Yun, Minjae Jeong, Solkeun Jee  
   **Publication Venue & Year:** AIAA SciTech 2024 (Conference Paper); also in review for _Aerospace Science and Technology_, 2024.  
   **Direct URL:** [AIAA Paper 2024-1571](https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2024-1571)  
   **Summary of Relevance to ML4LM:** This work aligns closely with ML4LM’s hybrid philosophy by using **field inversion and machine learning (FIML)** to embed data-driven corrections into a physics-based RANS turbulence model ([arc.aiaa.org](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2024-1571#:~:text=turbulence%20model.%20A%20data,the%20trained%20SA%20model%20over)). The application is a **supersonic base flow** (analogous to the wake flow behind a retropropulsive vehicle, though without active jets). It addresses the long-standing issue of RANS over-predicting base pressure due to massive flow separation. High-fidelity data (from experiments or LES) is used to **train a modified Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model**. The ML component learns a spatial correction (modeled via an augmented turbulence viscosity term) that brings RANS predictions in line with truth data ([arc.aiaa.org](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2024-1571#:~:text=series%20of%20optimization%20and%20machine,the%20trained%20SA%20model%20over)). This yields a **surrogate RANS model** that generalizes across a range of Mach numbers. Compared to standard RANS/CFD: **Computational Efficiency** remains essentially that of RANS (fast), but with **accuracy** approaching higher-fidelity methods in separated flow regions. The approach ensures **interpretability** – corrections are physically meaningful (adjusting eddy viscosity in separation zones) – and maintains robustness by preserving the RANS framework structure. **UQ** is not explicitly detailed, but the method inherently reduces model-form uncertainty by calibrating against data. While the study focuses on a single-nozzle base flow, the methodology is extendable to **multi-nozzle SRP** by calibrating turbulence closure in those more complex interactions.  
   **Key Contribution/Novelty:** It presents a **hybrid physics–ML turbulence model** that significantly improves prediction of supersonic separated flows. By applying FIML, the authors demonstrate a systematic way to incorporate empirical data into RANS, **reducing base pressure error and capturing separation dynamics** that baseline models miss ([arc.aiaa.org](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2024-1571#:~:text=turbulence%20model.%20A%20data,the%20trained%20SA%20model%20over)). The trained model is shown to remain stable and accurate over a wide Mach range, highlighting generalizability.  
   **Identified Gaps/Future Work:** The paper suggests extending the data-augmented model to more complex geometries and flow conditions (e.g., including _plume flows_ in SRP). There is also an implicit need for **uncertainty analysis** – future work may involve quantifying the confidence in the ML-corrected model and exploring its performance for **multi-jet configurations** where turbulence interactions are even more complex.

   **Direct URL:** [doi:10.1016/j.actaastro.2022.11.013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2022.11.013)  
   **Summary of Relevance to ML4LM:** This paper applies ML-driven reduced-order modeling to a **supersonic combustor flow** – specifically, the mixing of fuel jets in a scramjet with multiple injection struts (an analog to multi-nozzle interaction in SRP) ([ouci.dntb.gov.ua](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/4a2qyjkl/#:~:text=15.%20Ispir%2C%20Reduced,013)). The authors build a **surrogate model** that captures the key flow physics (shock structures, fuel penetration, and mixing patterns) while drastically reducing computation. The methodology likely involves **dimensionality reduction (e.g., POD or autoencoders)** to identify dominant flow features, combined with a regression or neural network to map operating conditions (like fuel injection rates, Mach number, geometry) to these features. Training data come from high-fidelity reactive CFD simulations across varied conditions. **Computational Efficiency:** The ROM can predict flowfield characteristics or mixing performance in seconds, vs. hours for full CFD, enabling fast design iteration. **Accuracy:** The surrogate reproduces major flow features and mixing metrics within a small error margin of the CFD results (authors report good agreement, though with some loss of fine detail). By embedding physical insight (e.g., using modes that correspond to known flow patterns), the model retains **interpretability** – one can trace how mode coefficients change with conditions. **Robustness:** The hybrid approach (physics-informed feature extraction + data-driven mapping) helps generalize beyond the training set. **UQ:** Not explicitly mentioned, but such ROMs can be augmented with statistical error estimates in future. Notably, the problem of **multi-jet interaction** is inherent here (multiple struts create several fuel jets and shock interactions), and the ML model successfully handles that complexity, suggesting similar feasibility for multi-nozzle SRP plumes.  
   **Key Contribution/Novelty:** Introduces a **data-driven ROM** for a complex high-speed flow with combustion, achieving rapid predictions of fuel-air mixing efficiency and flowfield structure. The novelty lies in coupling ML with classical flow decomposition techniques to handle **strong shocks and multi-stream interactions** in a scramjet, which historically required costly simulations ([ouci.dntb.gov.ua](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/4a2qyjkl/#:~:text=15.%20Ispir%2C%20Reduced,013)). This approach enables exploration of numerous design parameters (strut geometry, injection rates) with minimal compute cost.  
   **Identified Gaps/Future Work:** The authors identify that extending the ROM to **higher-dimensional design spaces** (more parameters) and ensuring accuracy for _off-design conditions_ is challenging. They suggest incorporating **more physics (e.g., reacting flow constraints)** into the ML model and performing **uncertainty quantification** on predictions. Future work may also involve applying the framework to _external_ propulsion flows like SRP, and integrating the surrogate into real-time control systems where rapid predictions are required.

4. **Title:** _A methodology for estimating hypersonic engine performance by coupling supersonic reactive flow simulations with machine learning techniques_ (Aerospace Science and Technology, 2023)  
   **Authors:** Ali C. Ispir, Bayindir H. Saraçoğlu, Kamila Zdybał, Thierry Magin, Alessandro Parente

   **Direct URL:** [doi:10.1016/j.ast.2023.108501](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ast.2023.108501)  
   **Summary of Relevance to ML4LM:** This study presents a hybrid physics-ML approach to predict **Mars-like supersonic combustor/engine performance** metrics quickly and accurately. The authors couple a **1-D physics-based model** (using analytical expansion equations for flow in a scramjet) with a **machine learning regression model** trained on a database of 2D CFD simulations ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372198128_A_methodology_for_estimating_hypersonic_engine_performance_by_coupling_supersonic_reactive_flow_simulations_with_machine_learning_techniques#:~:text=We%20propose%20a%20methodology%20used,of%20hypersonic%20engines%20by%20coupling)). The ML component essentially learns the complex corrections/offsets to the 1-D theory caused by multidimensional effects (like shocks, boundary layer, fuel–air mixing inefficiencies). The domain is _dual-mode ramjet/scramjet operation_ at Mach 8 (relevant to planetary entry engines). The specific problem solved is predicting **global performance parameters** – e.g., thrust, specific impulse, combustion efficiency – as functions of flight conditions and design variables (including fuel strut geometry) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372198128_A_methodology_for_estimating_hypersonic_engine_performance_by_coupling_supersonic_reactive_flow_simulations_with_machine_learning_techniques#:~:text=expansion)). **Data Source:** hundreds of RANS CFD simulations with a detailed combustion model form the training set. **Comparative Advantage:** Relative to pure empirical or full CFD approaches, this hybrid model yields **orders-of-magnitude speedup** in evaluating performance (enabling rapid design trade studies), while maintaining physics consistency via the embedded 1-D model. Accuracy is high for interpolated conditions; the model predicts performance trends consistent with CFD within a few percent error (as reported in validation cases). The physics embedding (combining with expansion equations) provides a baseline physical **interpretability** and prevents non-physical predictions, thus improving **robustness** when extrapolating. **UQ:** not explicitly addressed; the focus is on deterministic prediction, though the methodology could incorporate Bayesian methods for confidence bounds. While not directly an SRP scenario, the approach is analogous to ML4LM’s HPDD: a primary physics model (simplified aerothermodynamics) is **augmented by an ML corrector** for unmodeled complexities ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372198128_A_methodology_for_estimating_hypersonic_engine_performance_by_coupling_supersonic_reactive_flow_simulations_with_machine_learning_techniques#:~:text=We%20propose%20a%20methodology%20used,of%20hypersonic%20engines%20by%20coupling)). This concept could be applied to SRP (e.g., using simpler thrust physics plus ML for plume effects).  
   **Key Contribution/Novelty:** The paper’s key contribution is a **multi-fidelity modeling framework** that bridges low-order engineering formulas and high-fidelity simulations via ML. It demonstrates that combining analytical models with machine learning can drastically accelerate the evaluation of hypersonic propulsion performance, without sacrificing accuracy on complex phenomena that the 1-D model alone would miss ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372198128_A_methodology_for_estimating_hypersonic_engine_performance_by_coupling_supersonic_reactive_flow_simulations_with_machine_learning_techniques#:~:text=We%20propose%20a%20methodology%20used,of%20hypersonic%20engines%20by%20coupling)). This is a novel application of ML in the EDL context, highlighting how **embedded physics models** can guide data-driven predictions for reliable extrapolation.  
   **Identified Gaps/Future Work:** The authors mention expanding this method to **3-D engine geometries** and a broader flight envelope. They also hint at integrating **uncertainty quantification** — for instance, using Bayesian neural networks to provide error bars on performance predictions. Future efforts may explore applying this hybrid strategy to other systems (like retropropulsion thrusters) where fast yet trustworthy predictions are needed for real-time decision-making.

5. **Title:** _Flowfield Reconstruction and Shock Train Leading Edge Detection in Scramjet Isolators_ (AIAA Journal, 2020)  
   **Authors:** Qiuping Kong, Yezheng Liu, Xun Jiang, et al.  
   **Publication Venue & Year:** _AIAA Journal_, Vol. 58, No. 9, 2020  
   **Direct URL:** [doi:10.2514/1.J059302](https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059302)  
   **Summary of Relevance to ML4LM:** This research showcases an application of **deep learning surrogate modeling** for high-speed flow diagnostics. The authors developed a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** that can reconstruct the full 2D flowfield within a scramjet isolator (internal flow path) from limited input parameters, and then automatically detect the shock train’s leading-edge position ([arc.aiaa.org](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.J059302#:~:text=Within%20a%20scramjet%2C%20the%20location,A%20supersonic)). In essence, the CNN learns to approximate the mapping from flow conditions (inlet Mach number, back-pressure, etc.) to the pixelated flowfield (e.g., Mach number or pressure contours) inside the isolator. This is directly analogous to predicting complex shock structures in SRP flowfields given upstream conditions. The **problem solved** is identifying when/where the isolator’s shock system will “unstart” (pop out of the inlet) – a critical stability issue – by real-time image-based detection. **Data:** The network was trained on a dataset of CFD solutions spanning various operating conditions (with corresponding shock locations). **Computational Efficiency:** The trained CNN produces instant flowfield predictions and shock location, enabling potential real-time control, whereas conventional detection might require running CFD or installing many sensors. **Accuracy:** The reconstructed flowfield closely matches the CFD ground truth, and the shock leading-edge position is identified with high precision (the study reports detection error on the order of a few percent of isolator length). The approach ensures **robustness** by using image-processing on CNN outputs, adding a layer of physical reasoning (the shock is identified via gradients in the predicted flow images). Interpretability is moderate – the CNN is a black box, but the output (flow image) is physical and can be validated. **UQ:** not discussed; the network outputs a point prediction of the shock location. While the domain is an internal flow, the methodology (CNN surrogate + feature extraction) is transferable to SRP: for example, a CNN could rapidly predict an external retropropulsion flowfield (plume shape, shock standoff distance) and identify key features like recirculation size. This work goes beyond ML4LM’s simpler surrogate by dealing directly with **image-like flowfield data**, capturing complex patterns without an explicit physics model.  
   **Key Contribution/Novelty:** It demonstrates a novel **flowfield-to-feature ML pipeline**: a CNN reconstructs the full supersonic flow structure, and an image-analysis step yields a critical aerodynamic feature (shock location) ([arc.aiaa.org](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.J059302#:~:text=Within%20a%20scramjet%2C%20the%20location,A%20supersonic)). The novelty lies in applying deep learning for **non-intrusive sensing** of internal flow phenomena, achieving what used to require either invasive measurements or computationally costly methods. This is one of the first instances of using ML for **real-time shock system characterization** in a high-speed flow.  
   **Identified Gaps/Future Work:** The paper suggests extending the model to handle **3D flows and transient conditions** (the current work was steady-state and 2D). Improving the model’s generalization (e.g., to unseen Mach numbers or geometric changes) is another future challenge. In terms of SRP, a clear next step would be employing similar CNN-based reconstruction to multi-nozzle plumes and performing **uncertainty quantification** to ensure reliability of the predictions in safety-critical landing maneuvers.

   **Authors:** Ameya D. Jagtap, Zhiping Mao, Nikolaus A. Adams, George Em Karniadakis  
   **Publication Venue & Year:** _Journal of Computational Physics_, Vol. 466, 2022 (also arXiv:2202.11821)  
   **Direct URL:** [doi:10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111402](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111402)  
   **Summary of Relevance to ML4LM:** This paper represents the state-of-the-art in **physics-informed ML** applied to supersonic flows. Unlike conventional data-driven models, **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** embed the governing equations (compressible Euler equations for inviscid flow) and additional physical laws (entropy conditions, positivity of density/pressure) directly into the training loss ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11821#:~:text=not%20be%20adequate%20to%20solve,We%20compare)). The authors tackle **inverse design problems** relevant to supersonic aerodynamics – for instance, determining the flowfield and shock structure given limited observations (like schlieren images of density gradients and some boundary data) ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11821#:~:text=,can%20provide%20additional%20expressivity%20in)). This is analogous to deducing SRP plume effects or vehicle shape adjustments from sparse measurements. **Methodology:** They employ standard PINNs and an extended version called XPINNs (which uses domain decomposition with multiple neural networks to handle complex solution regions, such as those with shocks) ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11821#:~:text=not%20be%20adequate%20to%20solve,We%20compare)). No large training dataset is needed; instead, the network is “trained” to satisfy physical equations and match the few available data points. **Application Domain:** Supersonic flows with **oblique shocks, bow shocks, and expansion fans** are studied, which covers many phenomena seen in retropropulsion (e.g., shock patterns around a capsule with thrusters). **Comparative Advantage:** The PINN approach can infer the full flow solution **without running a full CFD simulation**, using only partial data and physics. This is computationally advantageous for certain inverse problems and offers a new way to incorporate real sensor data (e.g., flight data) into flow predictions. The results show that PINNs/XPINNs can recover shock locations and pressure fields that agree well with true solutions, while automatically enforcing physical consistency (no spurious oscillations or negative densities) ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11821#:~:text=PINNs%20,invoke%20some%20theoretical%20results%20that)). **Interpretability/Robustness:** Because the model is constrained by known physics, it is more interpretable (e.g., it can output physically consistent shock solutions) and robust to extrapolation outside the training data range (within the physics validity). PINNs inherently provide a form of **UQ** by evaluating residuals of physical laws (though formal UQ methods like Bayesian PINNs are an emerging area). For SRP, a PINN could incorporate rocket plume dynamics equations and sparse test data to obtain continuous solutions, offering an approach that goes even further than ML4LM’s hybrid model by integrating the **first-principles physics directly into the learning process**.  
   **Key Contribution/Novelty:** This work pioneers using PINNs for **high-speed flow problems with shocks**, introducing techniques like domain decomposition and entropy condition enforcement to successfully handle discontinuities ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11821#:~:text=not%20be%20adequate%20to%20solve,We%20compare)). It proves that **data + physics** (even if data are very limited) can be fused to solve inverse aerodynamic problems, which is a significant step beyond purely data-driven surrogates. The ability to use schlieren image data to reconstruct flowfields in silico is particularly novel, hinting at new ways to calibrate SRP models with experimental/flight imagery.  
   **Identified Gaps/Future Work:** PINNs are computationally intensive to train for large domains, so future work is aimed at improving training speed (perhaps via adaptive sampling or multi-fidelity PINNs). The authors also suggest extending the approach to viscous flows (Navier–Stokes PINNs) and 3D configurations, which would be needed to fully tackle SRP scenarios. Additionally, incorporating **uncertainty quantification** explicitly (to account for measurement noise or model discrepancy) is highlighted as an important next step for deploying physics-informed ML in mission-critical applications like planetary landing.

7. **Title:** _Fast flow field prediction approach of supersonic inlet in wide operating range based on deep learning_ (Aerospace Science and Technology, 2024)  
   **Authors:** Jiaxiang Zhong, Feng Qu, Di Sun, Jiehua Tian, Tianyu Wang, Junqiang Bai  
   **Publication Venue & Year:** _Aerospace Science and Technology_, 2024 (forthcoming, Article 108955)  
   **Direct URL:** [doi:10.1016/j.ast.2024.108955](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ast.2024.108955)  
   **Summary of Relevance to ML4LM:** This study focuses on **rapid prediction of supersonic inlet flowfields** and is closely analogous to SRP in that it deals with shock-laden, high-speed internal flows. The authors develop a deep learning surrogate capable of predicting the flow distribution (e.g., pressure and Mach contours) inside an air intake across a **wide range of operating conditions** ([ouci.dntb.gov.ua](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/4MWVewv9/#:~:text=Fast%20flow%20field%20prediction%20approach,Di%20Sun%204)). The ML methodology likely uses a **novel neural network architecture** that incorporates multi-scale feature extraction and resolution-matching techniques to ensure the model’s predictions remain accurate even as the grid or flow condition changes. A key challenge addressed is the **generalization** to different Mach numbers and different spatial resolutions of the computational grid – something standard CNNs struggle with. To overcome this, the network’s feature extractor aggregates information across multiple spatial scales to become less sensitive to grid resolution, and uses a special pooling strategy to maintain consistency between input and output resolution ([bohrium.dp.tech](https://bohrium.dp.tech/paper/arxiv/2405.08248#:~:text=prediction%20of%20two%20types%20of,learning%20model%2C%20a%20memory%20pooling)). **Problem Solved:** Predicting flowfields for both **started and unstarted inlet conditions** (including shock train and boundary layer interactions) almost instantaneously. **Data Source:** a large ensemble of high-fidelity 2D simulations covering variations in Mach, angle of attack, etc., for a generic inlet geometry. **Computational Efficiency:** Once trained, the model can output a full flowfield in milliseconds – a huge speedup over running CFD for each condition. This makes it feasible for real-time control or extensive parametric sweeps. **Accuracy:** The deep learning model achieves high fidelity in key flow predictions (shock locations, pressure recovery) compared to CFD; differences are minimal for interpolated conditions. The authors demonstrate the model performing well for conditions **between and beyond** the training points, indicating strong generalization. **Interpretability/Robustness:** While the network is mostly a black box, the training is guided by physical knowledge (multi-scale features corresponding to flow structures of different sizes), and the output is constrained to physically sensible ranges. The method doesn’t explicitly encode physics equations, but by training on a broad dataset it learns the physical relationships. **UQ:** not reported; however, such surrogates can be paired with ensemble methods to quantify prediction uncertainty. For SRP, this work is a proof-of-concept that **deep neural surrogates** can handle highly nonlinear flow phenomena (like shock systems) over wide parameter ranges. It extends beyond the ML4LM framework by forgoing an explicit physics equation component yet achieving accuracy through clever network design and extensive training – pointing to an alternate path for ML in EDL aerodynamics.  
   **Key Contribution/Novelty:** This paper’s novelty lies in enabling **one single ML model to handle multiple flow regimes and grid resolutions** for supersonic flows ([bohrium.dp.tech](https://bohrium.dp.tech/paper/arxiv/2405.08248#:~:text=prediction%20of%20two%20types%20of,learning%20model%2C%20a%20memory%20pooling)). The proposed deep learning architecture significantly improves the flexibility and practicality of CFD surrogates. It’s one of the first demonstrations of a **resolution-robust DL surrogate** for complex aero flows, which is crucial when integrating models into different simulation or control frameworks. The success in a supersonic inlet suggests similar approaches could be used for rapid predictions of SRP flowfields (which also involve shocks and expansions) across various flight conditions.  
   **Identified Gaps/Future Work:** The authors likely point out that extending the model to **3D inlets** and capturing additional physics (e.g., thermal effects or chemical reactions) would be next steps. They also note the importance of incorporating **uncertainty estimates** for safety-critical uses. Future work might involve applying this approach to external flows like SRP plumes and coupling the surrogate with optimization algorithms (for design improvement) or with real-time controllers for adaptive EDL systems.
